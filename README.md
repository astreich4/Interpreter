# Interpreter
This is a class project in which we built an interpreter for a simple, stack based langauge.
The Language handles basic computations ( add, subtract, negation, multiplication, division) as well as containing the ability to bind integers, strings, or names to names, essentially creating variables which is implemented in the interpreter.
The language also has scope with the use of Begin and End which is implemented in the interpreter.
The language also conatians functions as well as In/Out functions. Regular functions are implemented in the interpreter code, but not in/out funtions and trying to use one will generated error and unexpected outputs.

Test Files are provided for your convinince.
